  <h1>Privacy Policy – theBeetles</h1>

  <p>This app is used internally by our organization for team-building activities, onboarding, and company events. We value privacy and aim to keep all user data secure and limited to its intended use.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Team names (used to group participants)</li>
    <li>Photos submitted by users during challenges</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use This Data</h2>
  <p>Submitted photos are temporarily stored to evaluate challenge participation and calculate event scores. Team names are used only within the context of the event.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>All submitted photos are deleted from our Firebase storage shortly after each event ends. No personal data is retained or shared.</p>

  <h2>Your Data</h2>
  <p>theBeetles uses Apple’s sandboxed image picker, which only accesses images explicitly selected by the user. The app does not request access to the full photo library.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:pecalevskatefani@gmail.com">pecalevskatefani@gmail.com</a></p>
